# An Introduction to MPLAB XC8 Compiler for PIC Microcontrollers
 
If you are interested in programming 8-bit PIC microcontrollers, you will need a compiler that can translate your C or C++ code into machine code that can run on your device. One of the most popular and widely used compilers for PIC microcontrollers is the MPLAB XC8 compiler[^1^], developed and distributed by Microchip Technology.

In this article, I will give you an overview of what MPLAB XC8 compiler is, what features and benefits it offers, how to download and install it, how to use it with MPLAB X IDE[^1^], and how to choose a license type that suits your needs.
  
## What is MPLAB XC8 Compiler?
 
MPLAB XC8 compiler is a cross-platform compiler that supports all 8-bit PIC and AVR microcontrollers[^1^]. It is based on the open-source GCC compiler and provides a comprehensive set of features and optimizations for your projects. Some of the features of MPLAB XC8 compiler are:
 
- It supports C and C++ (C++ only available in MPLAB XC32++ compilers) languages, with extensions for PIC-specific features.
- It integrates with MPLAB X IDE, a free integrated development environment that provides code editing, debugging, simulation, programming and analysis tools.
- It offers three optimization levels: free, standard and pro. The free level provides basic optimizations and is available for unrestricted use. The standard and pro levels provide advanced optimizations that can reduce code size and improve performance, but require a paid license or a 60-day trial.
- It includes libraries and header files for various peripherals, such as timers, UARTs, SPIs, I2Cs, ADCs, DACs, LCDs, EEPROMs, etc.
- It supports code generation from graphical tools, such as MPLAB Code Configurator[^1^], which allows you to configure peripherals and libraries using a graphical interface.
- It supports various programming tools, such as PICkit 3[^1^], ICD 3[^1^], REAL ICE[^1^], etc., that can program your microcontroller with the hex file generated by the compiler.

## How to Download and Install MPLAB XC8 Compiler?
 
To download MPLAB XC8 compiler, you need to visit the official website of Microchip Technology[^1^] and choose the compiler that matches your microcontroller type. There are three compilers available: MPLAB XC8 for 8-bit PIC and AVR microcontrollers, MPLAB XC16 for 16-bit PIC microcontrollers and dsPIC digital signal controllers, and MPLAB XC32 for 32-bit PIC and SAM microcontrollers and MPUs featuring Arm and MIPS cores.
 
After downloading the compiler installer, you need to run it and follow the instructions on the screen. The installer will ask you to accept the license agreement, choose a destination folder, select a license type (free or pro) and optionally install additional tools and libraries[^2^].
 
After installation, you can launch MPLAB X IDE from the Start menu or the desktop shortcut. You can also check the version of your compiler by opening a command prompt window and typing `xc8 --version`.
  
## How to Use MPLAB XC8 Compiler with MPLAB X IDE?
 
To use MPLAB XC8 compiler with MPLAB X IDE, you need to create a project in the IDE that specifies your device type, tool type and compiler type. You can create a new project by clicking on File > New Project or by pressing Ctrl+Shift+N on your keyboard.
 
In the New Project wizard, you need to select a project type (for example, Standalone Project), a device (for example, PIC16F877A), a tool (for example, PICkit 3), a compiler (for example, XC8) and a project name and location[^2^].
 
After creating your project, you can write your code in C or C++ using the editor window. You can also use the code configurator tool[^1^] to generate code for peripherals and libraries automatically.
 
To compile your code, you need to click on Run > Build Project or press F11
